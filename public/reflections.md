## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. **Functions**
> Sections of code that are bundled up together. These can be called in order to execute the specific set of statements. These sections also need to be declared and then be wrapped around by an open and close brace.
2. **Switch**
> Switch is a statement that acts like a huge if else chain for string variables. It can have a lot of cases, then a default. Most switches use the break syntax in order to end immediately once a switch case fits.
3. **If/Else**
> If is a statement used to wrap a set of code that should only execute once a condition is fulfilled. It is accompanied by else which can be used after an if syntax. Else is used to wrap the section of code that should only execute if the condition listed in the if statement is not fulfilled. These can also be combined to create an else if which wraps around a section of code that executes should another condition be fulfilled instead of the first one.
4. **"!"** 
> "!", more widely known as not, is a syntax used to invert the result of a boolean statement. For example, if !(x === y) will result in **true** if (x === y) is **false**. It can also be put inside of == or === by != and !== respectively. Lastly, it can also be put before variables to basically fulfill all properties that are not inhibited by the value of the variable.
5. **While**
> While is a statement used to wrap a certain set of code in a loop that keeps executing until a certain condition is untrue. While loops always need a statement inside it that updates the variable being tested, or else the while will loop infinitely.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.
1. **Gathering Input**
> We have seen in many templates a way to gather input. But so far, personally, I feel that it hasn't been explored far enough for me to understand what **each part** of the statement means.
2. **Style**
> While it was highly encouraged to learn how to style, it hasn't really been expanded on as much as it could be. The farthest we have reached is background images and all of that sort.
3. **Do While Loops**
> I'm so sorry sir - I just was not taught this as much as while loops in Grade 8. Its really a me problem po...
4. **.js to .html**
> We know that javascript and html can communicate with each other, though, we don't really know why. I feel that it would be better if we knew the real reason how.
5. **Event Listeners**
> This is linked to the previous number. We know Event Listeners will execute a function when a certain button is pressed. Except we don't know how the Event listener, which is either the onclick outside the script or the AddEventListener in the script is observing...

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
I'll research more on these topics since these can act as roadblocks sometimes in me trying to understand pieces of code in .html, .css & .js.

By doing this, hopefully I won't overthink about random pieces of code in the future anymore. 

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

***Activities done in class that were effective:***
* Kahoot
* Bonus Exercises

These activities gave people the chance to bounce back and to more easily understand the topics without pressure. It also feels more fun since the class almost certainly always talks to each other to discuss their answers since there isn't.

***Activities done in class that weren't effective:***
* DEBUGGING.
* Khub...

While I realize that it is imperative to do these activities, I still felt that it was personally very boring... (I'm sorry sir...)
